# Hi, I’m Poramet 👋  
I like making stuff — stories, tools, videos, and the occasional math explanation.

## About Me  
I mess around with a bit of everything — coding, writing, filming, and tutoring.  
If it’s interesting and a bit challenging, I’m probably into it.

Learn cool stuff. Make cool stuff.
